Then they have to spend more money (even beyond the initial marketing budget) cleaning up the mess made by an inexperienced team.\n\n##### When it comes to visuals, cheap costs more. \n\nMost developers know this. But it’s difficult to choose the higher quality option when comparing budget and profit margins. Rarely do they make the correct decision preemptively. \n\nBut what if you literally have NO other options? What if you *have* to go with a “low budget?”\n\nWhile I believe ALL campaigns should return an ample ROI (thus justifying the higher initial investment in a better firm), I also understand that funds may still be scarce and time sparse  — so sometimes you have to make the best with what you got.\n\nIn that case, consider these points when hiring and managing a creative team for the visuals in your marketing campaign. \n\n#### Quality over quantity.\n\nClichéd? Yes. But still…\n\nA premium perception of your development should be the priority. Your ROI will increase by orchestrating two exceptional images rather than ten average images. (Although usually, they end up far below average.)\n\nThe goal is cohesion. No one looks at a single image and decides to buy. They look at the campaign as a whole and buy based on their feeling, which impacts their perception.\n\nAnything below that premium perception of your development - even a single image - will destroy the feel of your building in the marketing materials. A quality visual storefront for your development creates the perception that the building will also be quality.\n\nConversely, when someone looks at cheap marketing materials, they will wonder where else the developer cut corners.\n\nIf you need to show more spaces, then:\n\n#### Depict a clear message.\n\nDevelopers often fall into the trap of “more is better,” cramming as much as possible into each view. It creates the opposite effect of its intention.\n\nBusy images confuse the viewer with their lack of purpose. The viewer doesn’t know what they are supposed to look at, so information gets lost.\n\nFor example, imagine a commercial office space interior. Are you trying to show a client’s experience walking and getting a good impression of the company? Are you trying to show the technical features of the space? Are you trying to show the internal culture? You can’t have all three AND a compelling view.\n\nBy showing more, you reveal less.\n\nEach view needs a purpose within the entire campaign.\n\nIf you have a large space requiring more views, then instead:\n\n#### Utilize close-ups.\n\nYou can save money by reducing the content depicted in the scene.\n\nRather than display the entire café within an office space, take a close-up of just the kitchenette. Capture the feeling of someone about to enjoy a fresh cup of coffee right before work - the warm sunrise beaming through, the crisp aroma of freshly ground beans, and the tranquil moment before a zestful day of work.\n\nPeople buy based on emotion, not features.\n\nEvoke emotions more effectively through a smaller, more inexpensive view.\n\nYou can then utilize this technique to:\n\n#### Ensure image utilization.\n\nAre you familiar with the difference between image quality and image utilization in a marketing campaign? They serve different purposes.\n\nA single, high-quality exterior rendering of the entire building may look nice initially, but it may not fit cohesively on your project’s homepage or marketing brochure. Typically, you would request a separate view. But if you want to save money while maintaining quality, choose a view that you know will work in ALL consumer touchpoints - e.g., a close-up of the building's façade or a key architectural feature.\n\nYour marketing materials can then use cropped, zoomed-in, or overlay text on these images without losing its message. It also makes for a powerful intro that sparks the viewer’s curiosity, hooking them into viewing more.\n\nEnsure this is done preemptively within the initial strategic overview to save the most time, and get the highest ROI.\n\n‍\n\n##### At the end of the day, IF you have to go cheap, concentrate your resources toward a single goal to maximize the value of your visual marketing campaign.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\n‍\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-13T21:51:30.624954408Z","tags":null},"/notes/The-Problems-With-Using-An-In-house-Team":{"title":"The Problems With Using An In-house Team","content":"\n*Created*: *2023-03-10*\n*Version*: 1.00\n\n---\n\n**The key differences between an in-house creative department and a design firm.**\n\n---\n\nAfter studying over one thousand developments and speaking with over 100 developers, the evidence is clear.\n\nAn in-house creative department for architectural marketing campaigns ensures a quick route to mediocrity, reducing sales. \n\nYet most developers still opt for an in-house creative department. They tend to believe it either saves time and money, or they’ll get a better visual at the end. \n\nThe reality? Neither of these happen. \n\nDesign agencies specialize in niches, which produces a greater incentive to produce better results. I will cover why this happens and the difference between in-house creative departments and specialist design agencies. \n\n## INCENTIVE STRUCTURE\n\n### In-house\n\n**In-house departments have no inherent incentive to grow.**\n\nCreatives on an in-house team focus on abiding by the directions of the firm in which they work. \n\nSurvival and maintenance of the existing structure become the principal obligation. Phrases like “Don’t rock the boat” or “This is the way we do things here” squash any creativity, ambition, and innovation that new team members might have brought to the project. \n\nWhat’s the point of moving beyond survival if no intrinsic rewards exist? \n\nPersonal growth means more work for the same pay. \n\nAs such, their systems tend to be outdated and inferior. Something particularly concerning given our society’s current rate of technological advancement. \n\nThere are a few by-products of this phenomenon: \n\n* Failure to accurately diagnose the developers’ problems\n* Higher prices for work below industry standards\n* Inability to solve problems beyond the immediate project scope or expertise\n\nBy the way, that inability to solve problems beyond the creative’s immediate scope of work often hamstrings the entire project's success. \n\nTo diminish incentives even further, sub-par work has almost no consequences for the architectural firm. Developers will still work with the architect even if their in-house visual team creates marketing material that looks like something rendered from 30-year-old CG software. \n\nIn short, the reputation of the architectural firm protects the in-house team. The developer may not like the marketing material, but they don't want to risk the deal with a top-tier architecture firm. \n\nThis further exacerbates the inherent complacency of the in-house creative departments. It’s a shame, really. \n\n### Design Firms\n\n**The marketplace rewards design firms for exceptional results.**\n\nThe better their results, the more they grow. \n\nDesign firms feel the rewards of a successful project. They become tangible reminders that rewards create an inherent imperative toward growth. \n\nA design firm exists to create and grow. That simply won’t happen if they don’t put their clients first and consistently solve their clients’ problems with speed and a clear ROI. \n\nThe tangible rewards of success incentivize design first to invest in superior, modern systems that can accommodate the challenges of our times. \n\nPlus, the design firm and every single team member risks more since they operate in the open market. \n\n## PROJECT EXECUTION\n\n### In-house\n\n**In-house departments prioritize the needs of the firm they reside in over the developer.**\n\nThe existing structure results in teams operating as **executors** who simply take orders from developers or their superiors. (And I have yet to find an industry that doesn't joke about managers with no specialty in the skills of the team they manage - in this case, marketing, branding, or computer graphics.)\n\nCreative executors fail to hit the *real* objectives because they aren’t expected (or rewarded) for diagnosing the *needs* (not wants) of the developer. \n\nImagine a doctor prescribing you medication without taking the necessary precautions and asking you the right questions - let alone blindly trusting you when you say you want the medication from some commercial or what your friend liked. Yet, we allow creative teams this leeway when so many more lives depend on the success of the development.\n\n*In-house teams commit creative malpractice by blindly executing what their non-creative manager says they want.* \n\nAnd just like (some) doctors, they will prioritize their own needs (profit and prescribing you a medication to meet a quota) over what's best for you. They focus on THEIR architectural features - rather than what’s best for a successful marketing campaign for the project. Granted, certain architectural features may help a campaign but will *not* increase the value of your development all by themselves. \n\n### Design Firms\n\n**Design firms, by nature, must solve the needs of their developer directly.** \n\nThey cannot exist in any other capacity and survive. \n\nUnlike the in-house team, they work directly with YOU - no middleman, no incentive difference among shareholders. \n\nA design firm must increase the value of your development *because that lets them keep the privilege of your business.* \n\nIncreasing development value lets the design firm thrive in the open marketplace. Unlike the in-house team, they don’t work in a vacuum. Mistakes mean loss of business, and exceptional performance means tangible rewards. \n\nThe inherent structural dynamic incentivizes the design firm to operate as **strategists** rather than executors. They take the reins as orchestrators, which allows you to be the owners you're supposed to be.\n\nDeep marketing strategy understanding increases the value of the development more than any other marketing benefit. \n\n## **TALENT**\n\n### In-house\n\n**In-house departments have a difficult time attracting talent specific to that domain.**\n\nSpecialists know they have a marketable skill and take those skills to places that will reward them. That’s why they work for specialist firms. \n\nIn-house teams save payroll by hiring generalists, student interns, or someone who does design and visuals *on the side*. Regardless of their background, the department manager might have an MBA but lacks practical knowledge of what makes a development sell. \n\nThis works well for the architectural firm that can rely on the reputation of their architects. But it doesn’t benefit the developer. \n\n### Design Firms\n\n**Highly specialized design firms attract highly specialized talent.**\n\nFor exactly that reason, developers typically work with a series of specialists, as opposed to one generalist. \n\nPeople would rather be part of a firm that specializes in their area of interest rather than work in a small branch of a firm that does something else. When someone dedicates their life toward mastering a specific skill, they naturally gravitate to an organization that puts that skill (and themselves) as a priority. \n\nPriority in specialization supports the specialist in increasing their skills, earning rewards for that dedication and providing a sense of fulfillment. \n\nIt’s only natural for skilled creatives to opt for a specialty design firm. \n‍\n\n---\n\n##### **Like the creatives, developers opting for a specialized design firm will realize the same benefits because when accounts get tallied, in-house departments have no obligation to the reality of the market.**\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-13T21:51:30.624954408Z","tags":null},"/notes/The-Top-Questions-Developers-Must-Ask":{"title":"The Top Questions Developers Must Ask","content":"\n*Created*: *2023-03-10*\n*Version*: 1.00\n\n---\n\nThe best way to avoid a failed campaign is to prevent it.\n\nIt starts with picking the right firm. \n\nMost creative firms have *no idea* how the development process actually works. They rarely ask what role they play in the bigger picture. Still, many developers pick their creative firms based on perception rather than logic. That primarily stems from a lack of understanding of exactly what to look for and why. \n\nThis article gives you the framework to sort the good from the bad firms so you can have the most successful campaign possible. \n\nNote: Stick to the questions in order. They build off of one another, so if you get a “weak” answer early on, moving on to another firm will save you time.\n\n#### 1. HOW WILL YOUR SERVICE INCREASE PROFIT?\n\nFrom the outside, it may seem like it's an obvious and natural topic to discuss — especially if you come from the business world.\n\nHowever, in the creative world, creatives have challenges with the stigma around money. While the professionals who make careers in marketing move past it, a lack of comfort discussing profits indicates their level of experience (and likely competency) within the industry. \n\n##### Qualities of a weak answer:\n\n* Uncomfortable speaking about money.\n\nThose who have money have no problems speaking about it - and if they have money, they must be a successful firm. That’s the compensation for the value they provide to the marketplace.\n\n* Will defer to quality.\n\nGenerally, a firm that answers questions about profit with quality will give you nothing but execution. Execution alone does not make a successful campaign. Most anyone can execute an idea. The work itself does not increase the profitability of your project.\n\n##### Qualities of a strong answer:\n\n* They can show you past results\n\nAny good firm knows *exactly* how they produce results within the bigger picture of a project. They likely built their service *directly* upon those results - rather than on quality alone.\n\n#### **2. HOW WILL YOUR SERVICE SAVE US TIME?**\n\nThis question looks for the processes the firm has in place to make the service more effective for YOU. This can be through specific communication systems, review systems, and reports. \n\nE.g. Will they reduce meeting times? Will they make it easier for your to communicate with other shareholders?\n\nThese processes and procedures should back up the results stated in the first question.\n\n##### Qualities of a weak answer:\n\n* A 'similar' process to the rest of the industry.\n\nThis alone isn't bad. However, it just means you'll likely get a product that's the same as your competitors.\n\n* A process that focuses on *their* work.\n\nSimilar to the last question, if they are focusing on *their* work and internal system, you know that they optimized for results in *their* process, not yours. An effective system focuses on the end goal *first* then works backward to figure out how to achieve that — achieve the best efficiency for YOU, not for them.\n\n* Complex and difficult to explain.\n\nNo truly effective system is complex. If the firm can't explain it simply to you, they don't have an effective system.\n\n##### Qualities of a strong answer:\n\n* Definitive process with clear measurable results.\n\nExact stats, metrics, and processes ensure with a high probability of success for the project.\n\n* Examples of a proven process that worked with previous clients.\n\nA proven process may not strictly necessary. Working through a new system logically can ensure success, especially if your project offers unique scheduling or design challenges. \n\nHowever, a marketplace-tested system adds an extra layer of comfort. Note that price should be adjusted accordingly based on risk. So if it hasn’t been tested, their cost should be much lower. \n\n* Clear timelines.\n\nMore complex campaigns with more firms involved (particularly who have dependencies on key deliverables) make specific timelines especially important.\n\n#### **3. WHAT'S YOUR STRATEGY FOR THE PROJECT?**\n\nYou would think having a strategy would be more common. \n\nMost firms think they have one. Some firms have one for themselves. Very few firms have one for you and for the biggest picture of the project. \n\n##### Qualities of a weak answer:\n\n* Actually giving a response.\n\nThe challenge with this question lies in an inability to answer it without *knowing the* objectives of the project. Even if the answer seems obvious, a firm cannot make good decisions without the preliminary processes completed. The same way a doctor asks you questions regardless of the apparent symptoms. \n\n##### Qualities of a strong answer:\n\n* Will set up an intentional call to go over it further.\n\nGood firms will have a specific system in place to generate the strategy based on your *specific* project.\n\n#### **4. HOW WILL YOUR SERVICE HELP US LONG-TERM?**\n\nOnce you determine that the firm focuses on making you money, can effectively diagnose your problems, and have a clear process for achieving your goals, you can now ask this “trick” question. \n\nIt catches firms off-guard. Most project requirements don’t focus on long-term goals - as it’s not within the scope. However, a good firm becomes great when they can explain how they’ll help long-term. It classifies them as the one you ought to be working with for a long time. \n\nIt signifies that they truly focus on helping *you* and *your* project. \n\n##### Qualities of a weak answer:\n\n* They haven't thought about it.\n\nUnderstand that this is *most* firms. Rarely do firms care about the impact of their work beyond the scope of delivery. If this is the case, ensure you have a system in place internally to ensure the product's utilization within your future touchpoints. E.g. How will the marketing team or the branding team use the renderings?\n\n##### Qualities of a strong answer:\n\n* They'll have real-life case studies.\n\nThis ensures consistency of effective delivery over a broad range of different projects.\n\n* They'll have a separate service in place for this.\n\nAll great firms should have a process in place for post-delivery utilization and optimization. After all, what's the use of creating a phenomenal product if it's not utilized effectively?\n\n‍\n\n##### If they've answered all these questions in a 'strong' fashion, you can be confident that this firm thinks beyond themselves and will be a good investment for you. \n\n‍\n\n‍\n\n‍\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-13T21:51:30.624954408Z","tags":null},"/notes/Website-Taxonomy":{"title":"Website Taxonomy","content":"\n*Created*: *2023-03-10*\n*Version*: 1.00\n\n---\n\n# Symbols\n\n🗺️ = Database\n\n📍 = Sub Database\n\n📔 = Books\n\n👤 = People\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-13T21:51:30.624954408Z","tags":null},"/notes/callouts":{"title":"callouts","content":"\n## Callout support\n\nQuartz supports the same Admonition-callout syntax as Obsidian.\n\nThis includes\n\n* 12 Distinct callout types (each with several aliases)\n* Collapsable callouts\n\nSee [documentation on supported types and syntax here](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Use+callouts#Types).\n\n## Showcase\n\n \u003e \n \u003e \\[!EXAMPLE\\] Examples\n \u003e \n \u003e Aliases: example\n\n \u003e \n \u003e \\[!note\\] Notes\n \u003e \n \u003e Aliases: note\n\n \u003e \n \u003e \\[!abstract\\] Summaries \n \u003e \n \u003e Aliases: abstract, summary, tldr\n\n \u003e \n \u003e \\[!info\\] Info \n \u003e \n \u003e Aliases: info, todo\n\n \u003e \n \u003e \\[!tip\\] Hint \n \u003e \n \u003e Aliases: tip, hint, important\n\n \u003e \n \u003e \\[!success\\] Success \n \u003e \n \u003e Aliases: success, check, done\n\n \u003e \n \u003e \\[!question\\] Question \n \u003e \n \u003e Aliases: question, help, faq\n\n \u003e \n \u003e \\[!warning\\] Warning \n \u003e \n \u003e Aliases: warning, caution, attention\n\n \u003e \n \u003e \\[!failure\\] Failure \n \u003e \n \u003e Aliases: failure, fail, missing\n\n \u003e \n \u003e \\[!danger\\] Error\n \u003e \n \u003e Aliases: danger, error\n\n \u003e \n \u003e \\[!bug\\] Bug\n \u003e \n \u003e Aliases: bug\n\n \u003e \n \u003e \\[!quote\\] Quote\n \u003e \n \u003e Aliases: quote, cite\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-13T21:51:30.624954408Z","tags":null},"/notes/config":{"title":"config","content":"\n## Configuration\n\nQuartz is designed to be extremely configurable.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n   \n   ````yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n   enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n   ````\n\n1. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n   \n   ````markdown {linenos=false}\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n   ````\n   \n   ````\n   \n   ````\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\n\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n````html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n````\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n````yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n````\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n````yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n````\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\n\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n````yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n````\n\n## Styling\n\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\n\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n````toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n````\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-13T21:51:30.624954408Z","tags":null},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\n\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n1. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n1. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n1. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n1. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n1. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\n\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n````toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n````\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n````toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n````\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n````yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n````\n\nHave a custom domain?

There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), yet none of them have super easy to use *free* tools to publish that garden to the world.\n\nI've personally found that\n\n1. It's nice to access notes from anywhere\n1. Having a public digital garden invites open conversations\n1. It makes keeping personal notes and knowledge *playful and fun*\n\nI was really inspired by [Bianca](https://garden.bianca.digital/) and [Joel](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)'s digital gardens and wanted to try making my own.\n\n**The goal of Quartz is to make hosting your own public digital garden free and simple.** You don't even need your own website. Quartz does all of that for you and gives your own little corner of the internet.\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-13T21:51:30.628954502Z","tags":null},"/notes/preview-changes":{"title":"preview changes","content":"\nIf you'd like to preview what your Quartz site looks like before deploying it to the internet, the following\ninstructions guide you through installing the proper dependencies to run it locally.\n\n## Install `hugo-obsidian`\n\nThis step will generate the list of backlinks for Hugo to parse. Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (\u003e= 1.16) installed.\n\n````bash\n# Install and link `hugo-obsidian` locally\ngo install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian@latest\n````\n\nIf you are running into an error saying that `command not found: hugo-obsidian`, make sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\n\nAfterwards, start the Hugo server as shown above and your local backlinks and interactive graph should be populated!\n\n## Installing Hugo\n\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first. Then,\n\n````bash\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\ncd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Start local server\nmake serve\n\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\n````\n\n \u003e \n \u003e \\[!INFO\\] Docker Support\n \u003e \n \u003e If you have Docker installed already, open your terminal, navigate to your folder with Quartz and run `make docker`\n\nNow that you are happy with how your Quartz instance looks, let's get it hosted!\n\n \u003e \n \u003e 🌍 Step 5: [Hosting Quartz online!](hosting.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-13T21:51:30.628954502Z","tags":null},"/notes/private-note":{"title":"private-note","content":"\nThis page doesn't get published!\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-13T21:51:30.628954502Z","tags":null},"/notes/search":{"title":"search","content":"\nQuartz supports two modes of searching through content.\n\n## Full-text\n\nFull-text search is the default in Quartz. It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n````yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n````\n\n## Natural Language\n\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n1. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n1. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n1. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n1. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n1. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n````yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n````\n\n7. Push your changes to the site and wait for it to deploy.\n7. Check the Operand dashboard and wait for your site to index. Enjoy natural language search powered by Operand!\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-13T21:51:30.628954502Z","tags":null},"/notes/setup":{"title":"setup","content":"\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-13T21:51:30.628954502Z","tags":null},"/notes/showcase":{"title":"showcase","content":"\nWant to see what Quartz can do?

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\n\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\n\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\n\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](hosting.md) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\n\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n````shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n````\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\n\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\n\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\n\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n````shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n````\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\n\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\n\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\n\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\n\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\n\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\n\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n````markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n````\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\n\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\n\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\n\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n🐛 [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-13T21:51:30.628954502Z","tags":null},"/notes/updating":{"title":"updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
